# 100 Days Of Code - Log [Munira Omar]

### Day 1: October 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: started the Responsive web design certification on Freecodecamp and Finished the Basic HTML and HTML5 challenges.

**Thoughts:** I started the freecodecamp earlier but always left in the middle but am happy to restart it to and focus on finishing it no matter what happens.
